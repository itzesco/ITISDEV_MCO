                        <p class="text-justify">
                            David Charlton was born in Suderland, in Tyne and Wear, England, and was exposed to hairdressing at a very early age. Charlton came from a family of hairdressers—one of the most sought-after careers in England. At 16, he was working full-time at his uncle’s salon while studying at the Durham Technical College. After 3 years of studying, Charlton passed with distinction the City and Guilds of London Institute Examination in Men’s and Ladies’ Hairdressing. This distinction opened the opportunity for Charlton to go back to Tyne and Wear, this time in South Shields, to teach hairdressing. He also conducted workshops for the North East Hairdressers’ Federation.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            It was in 1978 when Charlton came to the Philippines. He was the manager of Rever Salon at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, and after becoming a partner and later on its sole owner, Charlton expanded the Rever Salon to five locations. In 1989, after seeing a need for a salon that would offer high-quality hairdressing at a customer-friendly price, Charlton established David’s Salon Inc. With the desire to share his expertise to more Filipinos, he opened the very first David’s Salon in New Farmer’s Market in Cubao, Quezon City.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-justify">
                            A realization of a need that has opened many opportunities, David’s Salon not just shared a unique style to many Filipinos, but likewise opened employment and skill acquisition opportunities for many promising Filipino stylists. Now the largest chain of salons in the Philippines, David’s Salon has 200 branches, and counting. Salons are present in key locations in the Greater Manila Area as well as in the provinces. In 2008, the first US branch of David’s Salon opened in Los Angeles, California, and in February 2010, the first David’s Salon branch in the Middle East opened in Dubai.

                            Laura Charlton is not only blessed with the same hairdressing skills that her father has – she is also not afraid to step out and forge her own path. The daughter of founder David Charlton, she grew up in England and started her career when she was only 16 years old. She was trained at the England South Tyne Side College and successfully completed her City&Guilds National Vocational Qualifications – Level 2 and 3 in Hairdressing, and Level 2 in Beauty Therapy, Advanced Nail Techniques, and Media Makeup. She started working at salons in England quickly after getting her Diploma in Hairdressing. Not one to rest on her laurels, she also trained with the prestigious Vidal Sassoon Academy in London for Advanced Cut and Color as well as Creative Cut and Color in 2007. In the same year, she came to the Philippines to be part of David’s Salon. Her first assignment was in David’s Salon Xiamen, China, where she stayed for 2 years. After that, she was posted in Manila, and served clients in The Podium, Pacific Star, and Mall of Asia branches.

                        <p class="text-justify">
                            A hairdressing powerhouse who has also trained in multiple fields of beauty, she headed the Beauty Department of David’s Salon, which specializes in nails, hair removal, lash extension, and spa services. She is also an in-demand brand ambassador, and has worked with not only some of the top international hairdressing brands but also international stylists. She has conducted extensive trainings and seminars nationwide to stylists and beauty professionals alike.

                        <p class="text-justify">
                            In late 2024, she assumed the role of Chief Executive Officer. Always innovating and pushing for new services and strategies that would serve the needs of clients, Laura is a dynamic game-changer who keeps David’s Salon ahead of the curve.

                            With her nurturing personality and wise advice to all those who approach her, it is no wonder that everybody fondly calls her “mother”. Marivic Aguibiador started with David’s Salon in 1987 as an Accounting Clerk, and is a licensed CPA. She is a graduate of the University of the East, with a BSBA Major in Accounting degree. However, her love for the brand and passion to help others allowed her to fearlessly take on bigger tasks and projects beyond accounting. Largely responsible for the rapid growth of David’s Salon in its early days in the 90s, she embraced the challenge of expanding and growing of the then-unknown salon through franchising and strategic partnerships.

                            Maria Luisa Flores is proof that hard work, good ethics, and kindness go a long way. A graduate of San Sebastian College of Recoletos, Bachelor of Science Tourism, Ms. Malou started in 1991 as a Roving Receptionist of Revér Salon Mandarin. Working alongside Mr. David Charlton in handling the elite Makati salon, she learned how to deal with clients and stylists with finesse and grace. She quickly rose through ranks and was promoted to Assistant Receptionist, and eventually became the Head Receptionist.

                        <p class="text-justify">
                            When Charlton created David’s Salon, she was a natural choice to be part of the HR Department. She started as an HR Assistant at the Rever Training Center, and then was promoted to HR Manager of the David's and Rever Training Center. David’s Salon requires a large workforce, and the Human Resources department is always on the lookout for fresh talent. But more than recruitment, HR also finds ways to develop the skills of every person in David’s Salon, while keeping their jobs fun and rewarding.

                        <p class="text-justify">
                            Since she stepped up as the Vice President of HR in 2002, she has led the HR team to fulfill the manpower requirements and obligations of all David’s Salons. She also seeks out opportunities and partnerships with organizations, allowing David’s Salon to give back and reach out to communities in need.

                        <p class="text-justify">
                            Always pleasantly smiling and with a good word for everyone, this poised lady leads the Human Resources Department with not just decades of experience, but also an eagerness to serve others. Having started from the bottom, she always has a heart for the welfare of all staff, and believes that with proper training and guidance, anyone can succeed in life.
